# Basic OpenGL with GLFW: Vertex Shaders

This program introduces basic concepts involved in writing an OpenGL program.

# About

Vertex Shaders can be used to transform the vertices of your shapes.
This example builds on top of the Intro to Shaders example, and demonstrates using uniforms in the vertex shader to multiply transform with a world matrix.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
